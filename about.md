### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tuan-Dung Bui ðŸŒ± (aka Zhao).

Iâ€™m a second-year student, majoring in Information Technology.
Currently, I am interested in Machine Learning and hope to use artificial intelligence in medical sciences someday.
I also love tinkering with software and contributing to open-source projects. And I am constantly learning and
improving myself everyday.
