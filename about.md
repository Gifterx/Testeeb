# ...this site

**Writing forces sharper understanding** - Andy Matuschak

Yes, I created this site to improve my writing skills. It's where I share ideas and experiences about things I've researched or worked on. Because it's my first time writing, it's inevitable that I'll make some unexpected mistakes. Hope readers can ignore and give me suggestions to improve day by day.
